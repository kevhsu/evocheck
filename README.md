Given a list of players, get notable players each player will face.

Look at script/sample.rb to see the runpath.

Writing to JSON files/storing stuff in memory instead of using MySQL or something on the basis that the data sizes were relatively small. The code would actually be easier if I used an RDBMS LOL

Getting Started
----------------

 - Unix system (Developed on OS X, but would go with Ubuntu in prod or
   something. Will create Vagrant box if necessary) 
 - Ruby 2+

```
git clone <see URL>
bundle exec
```
